This code is written as part of the EPSRC project - "Models in the Cloud". This code creates a cluster of machines having WRF installed on it to support running multiple simulations. This work was also supported by various grants from Microsoft Azure including Azure AI4 Earth.
These scripts could be used to install WRF on virtual machines of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web services.
WRF source code, testing code and libraries are taken from http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf
